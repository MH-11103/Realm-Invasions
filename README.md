# TechWizard-Wars
The overall theme of the game is revolving around wizards / cyborgs. When they will be protecting a centralised code in the middle of the base 
which would be invaded by robots of three different types, each having their own unique attribute. In this world we will be guided by our friendly
neighbourhood wizard going by the name of Marilyn who'll give us an inside on why is it important for us to protect the core of this universe 
we will also be a company by other fellow warriors from other universities
